# Jeopardy
pringboard Software Engineering Bootcamp - Jan 2022 Cohort - Project completed 2/19/22

## Assignment
Second skills assessment for the course. I had to connect with jservice.io api and retrieve jeopardy clues/answers. I created a table with a simple start button to begin the game.

## To Do
The code is working but could be simplified much further. Css adjustments need to be made to improve the look of the game. I did not add the "loading spinner" as instructed becuase the loading process is extremely brief.
